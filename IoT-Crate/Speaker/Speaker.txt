## Bluetooth Speaker
<p>I salvaged a pcb from an old bluetooth speaker, added a new lithium rechargeble batery and a new speaker.<br>
I've cut some holes in my crate and  now it has space for:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The audio jack</li>
  <li> The USB-C entry for charging</li>
  <li> For the shitty mic built-in the pcb</li>
  <li> The button that turns the bluetooth on</li>
</ul>
